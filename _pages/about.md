<!-- 
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->

## UPDATES

### 14-12-2024 I will be presenting a tutorial on distributed GNN training at CODS-COMAD'24 on 18th December[Tutorial Website](https://github.com/gagan-iitb/DIST_GNN/)
### 01-07-2024 I have joined Microsoft Research India as a Research Fellow.
### 04-11-2023 My first paper accepted at ICDM'23 [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02399) [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415701)

I am a young researcher and engineer with keen interest in development of ML Systems. Currently I am working at Microsoft Research India as a Research Fellow as a part of the AI Infra team. Our current focus is on making LLM inference more efficient. 

My previous work was on distributed training of graph neural networks, developing better partitioning schemes of graph datasets that yield better accuracy through distributed training. Class imbalance is a prevalent problem graph datasets and needs to be handled to achieve better accuracies. This work focused on researching loss functions and sampling techniques that mitigate class imabalance and achieve better macro-F1 scores. We were able to bring some speed up in training and improve the macro and micro-F1 scores. The work was accepted at ICDM'23.

Before joining MSR I worked as a SDE at Publicis Sapient. My work there focused building efficient and accessible frontends. I won an award for Learning Mindset during our annual client townhall.

<!-- Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html). -->
