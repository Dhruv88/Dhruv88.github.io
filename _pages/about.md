<!-- 
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->

About Me:
======
I am a young researcher and engineer with keen interest in Graph Neural Networks and development of ML Systems. I have been a part of Amazon ML Summer School and Google ML Bootcamp that only select a 1000 students from all over India. These programs introduce students to the ML Domain and help them to develop relevant skills. As a part of these programs I got the opportunity to attend some very interesting talks in ML domain from Data and Research scientists at Amazon and also some promosing ML/AI startups. I also completed Andrew Ng's Coursera Deep Learning Specialization as a part of these programs. 

I was also granted an undergraduate research fellowship by TIH IIT Bhilai. As a research fellow I worked with my team on a designing and developing a prototype for a bike renting system using the LoRaWAN technology for our university campus. I also have experience in software engineering through my internship at Publicis Sapient. During this internship our team developed and deployed a face recognition microservice for point of sale checkout terminals. We improved upon the previous design making it 25% more efficient. 

I am currently researching on scalability and distributed training of graph neural networks, developing better partitioning schemes of graph datasets that yield better accuracy through distributed training. Class imbalance is a prevalent problem graph datasets and needs to be handled to achieve better accuracies. My current work also focuses on researching loss functions and sampling techniques that mitigate class imabalance and achieve better macro-F1 scores. In a recent work submitted to ICDM conference we have been able to come up with such techniques that give a 3-4x speed up in training and also boost the accuracy by 1%. 

I actively looking for research opportunities in these areas. You can reach out to me on LinkedIn or via email. 

<!-- Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html). -->
