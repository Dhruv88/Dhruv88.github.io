An year back I was working on a project of making a memory efficient CNN training framework. We needed a dataset to train on large convolutional network. I scaled the standard MNIST digit dataset from 28x28 images to 224x224 and stored them in the raw binary format. I later thought someone might find it useful so I posted it on Kaggle. Now, today when I checked people had downloaded the dataset over the year. Finding that your work is useful to someone is really satisfying and I felt really excited. I look forward to make more such contributions in the future. 
Here is the link to the dataset in case any one needs it.
