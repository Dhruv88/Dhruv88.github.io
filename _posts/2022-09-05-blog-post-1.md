An year back I was working on a project of making a memory efficient CNN training framework. We needed a dataset to train on large convolutional network. I scaled the standard MNIST digit dataset from 28x28 images to 224x224 and stored them in the raw binary format. I later thought someone might find it useful so I posted it on Kaggle. Now, today when I checked people had downloaded the dataset over the year. Finding that your work is useful to someone is really satisfying and I felt really excited. I look forward to make more such contributions in the future. 
Here is the link to the dataset in case any one needs it.

If you find the dataset useful and have a Kaggle account do leave an upvote! Cheers!
