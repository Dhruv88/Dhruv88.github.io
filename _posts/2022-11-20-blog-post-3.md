Bayesian Networks are a really interesting tool when it comes to conditional probabilities. When you have set of dependent events you can form a network/graph of the dependencies. Now you only need the absolute probabilities for some root events and the conditional probabilities for directly linked events and you can start computing the probabilities for certain events in the network with complex dependencies. Here is a tutorial showing you how can you construct a bayesian network in Python on a library called pomegranate and start computing of different linked events.
